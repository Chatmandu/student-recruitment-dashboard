# üîß Quick Fix for 404 Errors

## The Problem
The serverless functions (Mailchimp and Ticket Tailor) are returning 404 errors because Netlify didn't install the required `axios` package when you did drag-and-drop.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Re-Upload with Build Command

### Option 1: Use Updated Folder (Recommended)

1. **Download the updated folder** (it now has proper build configuration)
2. **Delete your current site** in Netlify (or create a new one)
3. **Drag and drop** the updated folder
4. **Add environment variables** again
5. Done!

### Option 2: Connect to Git (Best Long-term)

This will solve the problem permanently:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd student-recruitment-dashboard
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **In Netlify:**
   - Delete current site (or start fresh)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect to your GitHub repo
   - Netlify will auto-detect settings
   - Deploy!

3. **Add environment variables:**
   - Go to Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Add all 5 variables
   - The site will auto-redeploy

### Option 3: Add Build Command Manually

1. **In Netlify**, go to: **Site settings** ‚Üí **Build & deploy** ‚Üí **Build settings**

2. **Set Build command to:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Publish directory to:**
   ```
   public
   ```

4. **Trigger a redeploy**

## Why This Happened

When you drag-and-drop, Netlify doesn't always run `npm install` to get dependencies. The serverless functions need the `axios` package to make API calls to Mailchimp and Ticket Tailor.

## What I Fixed

- ‚úÖ Changed build command from `echo` to `npm install`
- ‚úÖ Added package-lock.json
- ‚úÖ Added .npmrc configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated dependencies

## After Re-uploading

You should see in the deploy log:
```
Installing dependencies
npm install
...
Functions bundled successfully
```

Then your Mailchimp and Ticket Tailor data will load!

## Quick Test

After redeploying, check browser console (F12):
- ‚ùå Before: "404 errors"
- ‚úÖ After: No errors, data loads

**Recommended:** Use Option 2 (Git) for easiest future updates and automatic redeployments.
