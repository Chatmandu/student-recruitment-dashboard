### Setting Up Applicant Tracking

**Important**: The dashboard identifies applicants by the "Applicant" tag in Mailchimp.

1. **When someone applies**, add a tag:
   - Go to the contact
   - Click "Add tags"
   - Type "Applicant"
   - Save

2. **Automate it** (optional):

3. **Bulk tagging**:
   - Select multiple contacts
   - Click "Add tags"
   - Add "Applicant" tag
   - Apply to all selected

### What the Dashboard Tracks

- **Total Members** in your audience
- **Leads** = Total members WITHOUT "Applicant" tag
- **Applicants** = Members WITH "Applicant" tag
- **Weekly Growth** (new subscriptions)
- **Conversion Rate** = Applicants / Total Members

2. **Add tags**:
   - Look for "Tags" field
   - Add: `student-recruitment`

#### Best Practices for Tags:

```
‚úÖ Good tags:
- student-recruitment
- student-open-day
- recruitment-campaign
- undergraduate-recruitment

‚ùå Won't be tracked:
- marketing
- general

```

## üé´ Ticket Tailor Setup

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Log in to Ticket Tailor**: https://www.tickettailor.com

2. **Go to Settings**:
   - Click "Settings" in the sidebar

3. **Navigate to API Settings**:
   - Look for "API" or "Integrations"
   - Click "API"

4. **Generate an API Key**:
   - Click "Generate new API key"
   - Give it a name: "Student Recruitment Dashboard"
   - **Copy the key**

5. **Set Permissions** (if asked):
   - Read access to: Events, Issued Tickets
   - This is typically the default

### Event Setup for Tracking

The dashboard automatically pulls:
- All published events
- Ticket types and quantities
- Issued tickets
- Check-in status

#### To Get Full Data:

1. **Publish Your Events**:
   - Unpublished events won't show
   - Dashboard filters for status: "published"

2. **Set Ticket Quantities**:
   - Define how many tickets available
   - This determines capacity

3. **Enable Check-in** (for attendance tracking):
   - In event settings
   - Enable "Check-in" feature
   - Use Ticket Tailor app to check people in at event

### What the Dashboard Tracks

For each event:
- Event name, date, venue
- Total capacity (sum of all ticket types)
- Tickets sold
- Tickets available
- Percentage sold
- Checked-in attendees
- No-shows (sold but not checked in)

Overall metrics:
- Total events
- Upcoming vs past events
- Overall capacity utilization
- Total attendance rate

### Tracking No-Shows

**Important**: No-show tracking requires using Ticket Tailor's check-in feature.

1. **At the event**:
   - Use Ticket Tailor mobile app
   - Scan tickets or manually check in attendees

2. **Dashboard calculates**:
   - No-Shows = Tickets Sold - Checked In
   - Attendance Rate = Checked In / Tickets Sold

3. **If you don't use check-in**:
   - Dashboard will show 0% attendance
   - This is expected - just ignore that metric
